Clickbait links to a web page and advertises its contents by arousing curiosity instead of providing an informative summary. Our contributions are approaches to classify the type of spoiler needed (i.e., a phrase or a passage), and to generate appropriate spoilers. A large-scale evaluation and error analysis on a new corpus of 5,000 manually spoiled clickbait poststhe Webis Clickbait Spoiling Corpus 2022shows that our spoiler type classifier achieves an accuracy of 80%, while the question answering model DeBERTa-large outperforms all others in generating spoilers for both types.
